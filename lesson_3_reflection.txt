1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A) When there is a need to collaborate work from many members. 
   If the work location changes often. 
   Working on remote desktop.
   
2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A) Because I may have my version being updated and I do not want the new feature 
that were added on remote repo. That might break my code or bring conflict.
Or my changes would be overridden.

3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?
A) Banches is done on same repository. To work on some bug fix or features.
   Clones makes a copy of a remote repository onto a local repository. 
   Fork is like copy but concept of GitHub. It makes a copy of remote repo onto
   remote machine.
